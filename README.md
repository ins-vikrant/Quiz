My approach while making this website was to make uses of classes and functions. 
In this quiz website, in order to create a landing page I just set display hidden to my main content and when the button start is clicked my main content is showed and the so called landing page disapprears. 
the questions are just coded wihtin the java script file. 
Now initially you have an option of skip button ,but when you click on any option it is converted in next. 
when you click on any button  a ripple effect is generated using animation which I want to confine within the button ,but I couldn't make its overflow hidden. 
now if you clicked on wrong answer your ticked option will turn red and it will show you the answer in green color,the logic behind it is adding classes to option by using functions and giving style to those classes. 
when you click on next/skip button the classes are used to reset the options.
